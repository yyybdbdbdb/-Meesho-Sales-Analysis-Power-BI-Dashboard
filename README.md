# -Meesho-Sales-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
An end-to-end sales performance analysis built using Power BI on Meesho’s order data. This project focuses on identifying key patterns across orders, returns, profitability, and RTO (Return to Origin) performance.
🔍 Key Highlights
🧾 Overall Performance
Total Orders: 138

Delivered Orders: 50

Failed Orders (RTO): 88

Total Sales: ₹187K | Net Sales: ₹179K

Avg. Order Value: ₹1.36K

Net Profit: –₹468 (Loss)

RTO Rate: 15.94%

🛍️ Sales Insights
Mid-Range category drives the highest sales (~₹100K+), but also incurs the largest losses, suggesting high return rates or low margins.

Premium segment performs moderately well with better profit control.

Budget products see minimal activity and almost no impact on profit or loss.

🚛 RTO & Return Analysis
88 failed deliveries (RTOs) – a major contributor to negative profit.

Highest RTO Rate by Size: Size "S" has a 100% RTO rate – needs urgent review.

Top States by RTO Rate:

Seoni & Andhra Pradesh – nearly 100% RTO

Delhi, Assam, Uttar Pradesh – also show elevated RTO trends

🗓️ Time-Based Patterns
Weekday sales outperform weekends.

Peak Sales: ₹131K on the 8th (weekday)

Weekend performance is significantly lower (~₹47K)

📦 Order Status Breakdown
Returns + RTOs account for 64 out of 138 orders (~46%) – a major red flag for logistics and quality.

Only 36% of orders were successfully delivered.

Returned products alone contributed to ₹51K in lost revenue.

🗺️ Regional Insights
Sales are distributed across India, with higher concentration in central and southern regions.

A few high-risk RTO zones (Seoni, Andhra, Delhi) require strategic intervention.

✅ Recommendations
Audit product sizes (especially 'S') – 100% RTO rate is unsustainable.

Refine pricing strategy for Mid-Range products – high sales but heavy losses.

Target regions with low RTO rates to improve fulfillment success.

Boost weekday campaigns – capitalize on higher conversion and AOV trends.

Investigate logistics and quality issues in high-RTO states for cost control.
